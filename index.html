<font face= "comic sans MS" color="olive"><p>The crimes that Nazis committed were linked to a system of belief 
and a set of practices. Nazi ideology was synonymous with Hitlers worldview. According to this there was no 
equality between people, but only a racial hierarchy. In this view blond, blue-eyed, Nordic German Aryans were 
at the top, while Jews were located at the lowest rung. They came to be regarded as an anti-race, the arch-enemies 
of the Aryans. All other coloured people were placed in between depending upon their external features. Hitlers 
racism borrowed from thinkers like Charles Darwin and Herbert Spencer. Darwin was a natural scientist who tried 
to explain the creation of plants and animals through the concept of evolution and natural selection. Herbert 
Spencer later added the idea of survival of the fittest. According to this idea, only those species survived on 
earth that could adapt themselves to changing climatic conditions. We should bear in mind that Darwin never 
advocated human intervention in what he thought was a purely natural process of selection. However, his ideas were 
used by racist thinkers and politicians to justify imperial rule over conquered peoples. The Nazi argument was simple: 
the strongest race would survive and the weak ones would perish. The Aryan race was the finest. It had to retain its 
purity, become stronger and dominate the world.</p></font><br>
<font face= "comic sans MS" color="olive"><p>The other aspect of Hitlers ideology related to the geopolitical concept 
of Lebensraum, or living space. He believed that new territories had to be acquired for settlement. This would enhance 
the area of the mother country, while enabling the settlers on new lands to retain an intimate link with the place of 
their origin. It would also enhance the material resources and power of the German nation.</p></font><br>
<font face= "comic sans MS" color="olive"><p>Hitler intended to extend German boundaries by moving eastwards, to concentrate 
all Germans geographically in one place. Poland became the laboratory for this experimentation.</p></font><br><br>

<font face= "comic sans MS" color="olive"><p>Once in power, the Nazis quickly began to implement their dream of creating 
an exclusive racial community of pure Germans by physically eliminating all those who were seen as  undesirable in theextended 
empire. Nazis wanted only a society of pure and healthy Nordic Aryans. They alone were considered desirable. Only they 
were seen as worthy of prospering and multiplying against all others who were classed as undesirable. This meant that even 
those Germans who were seen as impure or abnormal had no right to exist. Under the Euthanasia Programme, Helmuths father
along with other Nazi officials had condemned to death many Germans who were considered mentally or physically unfit.</p></font><br>
<font face= "comic sans MS" color="olive"><p>Jews were not the only community classified as undesirable. There were others. 
Many Gypsies and blacks living in Nazi Germany were considered as racial inferiors who threatened the biological purity of 
the superior Aryan race. They were widely persecuted. Even Russians and Poles were considered subhuman, and hence undeserving 
of any humanity. When Germany occupied Poland and parts of Russia, captured civilians were forced to work as slave labour. 
Many of them died simply through hard work and starvation.</p></font><br>
<font face= "comic sans MS" color="olive"><p>Jews remained the worst sufferers in Nazi Germany. Nazi hatred  of Jews had a 
precursor in the traditional Christian hostility towards Jews. They had been stereotyped as killers of Christ and usurers.
Until medieval times  Jews were barred from owning land. They survived mainly through trade and moneylending. They lived in 
separately marked areas called ghettos. They were often persecuted through periodic organised violence, and expulsion from 
the land. However, Hitlers hatred of Jews was based on pseudoscientific theories of race, which held that conversion was no 
solution to the Jewish problem. It could be solved only through their total elimination.</p></font><br>
<font face= "comic sans MS" color="olive"><p>From 1933 to 1938 the Nazis terrorised, pauperised and segregated the Jews, 
compelling them to leave the country. The next phase, 1939-1945, aimed at concentrating them in certain areas and eventually 
killing them in gas chambers in Poland.</p></font><br><br>
<font color="red"><i><u><h2>The Racial Utopia</h2></u></i></font><br>
<img src="3.jpg" height=200 width=400 align=right> 
<font face= "comic sans MS" color="olive"><p>Under the shadow of war, the Nazis proceeded to realise their murderous, racial ideal. 
Genocide and war became two sides of the same coin. Occupied Poland was divided up. Much of north-western Poland was annexed to 
Germany. Poles were forced to leave their homes and properties behind to be occupied by ethnic Germans brought in from occupied 
Europe. Poles were then herded like cattle in the other part called the General Government, the destination of all undesirables of 
the empire. Members of the Polish intelligentsia were murdered in large numbers in order to keep the entire people intellectually 
and spiritually servile. Polish children who looked like Aryans were forcibly snatched from their mothers and examined by race experts. 
If they passed the race tests they were raised in German families and if not, they were deposited in orphanages where most perished. 
With some of the largest ghettos and gas chambers, the General Government also served as the killing fields for the Jews.</p></font><br>
